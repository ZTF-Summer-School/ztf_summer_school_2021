Course materials for ZTF Summer School 2021

### Purpose

This course will introduce key concepts and techniques used to work with large datasets, in the context of the field of astrophysics. In the first 3 days of the course, the focus will be on the modern approaches to creating and manipulating large data sets, with the focus on time series analyses and Bayesian methods applied to astrophysics survey data. The remaining part of the course will focus on a range of machine learning techniques for processing data: classification algorithms (supervised and unsupervised learning), clustering algorithms, regression problems, recommender systems, graphic models and others. The algorithms will first be introduced in lectures, and the emphasis will then be placed on homework worked as teams in which the students will apply the algorithms (and already available packages) to astrophysical data sets to answer specific astrophysics questions. The course will assume familiarity with basic concepts in astrophysics, but it will include brief reviews as needed to demonstrate the use of modern data analysis techniques.
